# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description
A portfolio of work serves as a means to exhibit skills and talents, catering to employers seeking candidates for both part-time and full-time positions. An effective portfolio not only showcases the most robust work but also elucidates the underlying thought processes. Students possessing portfolios featuring deployed web applications—indicating their live presence on the web—tend to experience considerable success in their career search post-boot camp. Emphasizing this, it is essential to note that many companies consider having multiple deployed projects as a fundamental prerequisite for securing an initial interview.

With these considerations in mind, this coding assignment is designed to strategically position me for future success by applying recently acquired core skills: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The completion of this assignment enables me to hone these skills while simultaneously crafting a tangible asset for use during my job search.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptence Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
