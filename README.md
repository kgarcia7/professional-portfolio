#HTML Module 2 Challenge

## User Story
As a coding bootcamp student
I want to meet all the acceptence criteria listed in the class repo for Module 2
So that I can successfully accomplish this week's challenge of creating a portfolio page that samples my work and showcases my skills and talents

## Acceptence Criteria
GIVEN the portfolio sample and acceptence criteria in the Module 2 assignment
WHEN I create the source code using my understanding and knowledge of HTML and CSS 
THEN I can view my portfolio which creates a responsive layout and showcases my background, work, and contact information.
